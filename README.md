The sign up process is fairly straightforward, and you’ll need to pay a one-time registration fee of $25. After you’ve reviewed and accepted the Developer Distribution Agreement, you can proceed to make the payment using your credit or debit card.

To finish the sign up process, fill out all your necessary account details, including your Developer Name, which will be visible to your customers on Google Play. You can always add more details later.

Also, do remember that it can take up to 48 hours for your registration to be fully processed.
